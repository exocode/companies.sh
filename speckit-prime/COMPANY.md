description: >
  Autonomous Spec-Driven Development company that runs the full Spec-Kit
  pipeline — constitution, specify, clarify, checklist, plan, tasks, analyze,
  implement — with vertical-slice refinement and a bounded QA/review→refine
  loop. Respects Spec-Kit's native scripts and artifact structure. Resumes from
  existing artifacts. Runtime-agnostic; escalates to a human only on material
  ambiguity, and only through the CEO.

goals:
  - Run the full Spec-Kit lifecycle in the required order from constitution through implementation
  - Respect Spec-Kit's native feature directory, template, script, and feature-state structure
  - Resume safely from partially completed Spec-Kit artifacts such as an existing plan, tasks file, analysis output, or implementation branch
  - Stay model-, provider-, router-, adapter-, CLI-, and agent-runtime-agnostic
  - Keep user interruptions limited to genuine material ambiguities, missing product decisions, or approval gates — all routed through the CEO
  - Refine over-large plans and tasks into smaller, verifiable vertical slices
  - Add QA and review feedback loops without breaking Spec-Kit artifact dependencies

SpecKit Prime is an autonomous delivery company for GitHub Spec Kit projects.
It is designed for orchestrators (Paperclip, RunFusion Fusion, or any compatible
runner) that need a durable, reliable workflow instead of a loose prompt chain.
It is deliberately agnostic about model provider, router, adapter, CLI, agent
runtime, and local tool stack.

The company preserves this Spec Kit command order exactly:

1. `resume-detect` (pre-flight scan — always first)
2. `/speckit.constitution`
3. `/speckit.specify`
4. `/speckit.clarify`
5. `/speckit.checklist`
6. `/speckit.plan`
7. `/speckit.tasks`
8. `refine-slices` (inserted pass — immediately after tasks)
9. `/speckit.analyze`
10. `/speckit.implement`
11. `qa-review → refine loop` (inserted pass — after each implemented slice)

The workflow adds control around the commands, not inside them.

## Org Chart

```
CEO — Chief Spec Officer & Pipeline Orchestrator   (constitution, orchestration, single human gate)
├── Spec Analyst                                    (specify, clarify, spec-critic)
├── Clarify Challenger                              (adversarial clarify review — runs before human gate)
├── Spec Reviewer                                   (independent spec gate — blocks planning)
└── CTO — Chief Technology Officer                  (owns the build sub-pipeline)
    ├── Solution Architect                          (plan)
    ├── Task Slicer                                 (tasks + refine-slices)
    ├── Implementation Engineer                     (implement)
    └── QA Reviewer                                 (checklist, analyze, qa-review loop)
```

## What Makes This Company Different From a Raw Spec-Kit Run

Three things hurt an unattended Spec-Kit run:

1. **Orchestrators collapse into executors** — without hard dispatch rules, an
   LLM acting as CEO will start writing specs, plans, or code itself instead of
   delegating. The company forbids this explicitly in every orchestrator agent.
2. **`tasks` is often too coarse** — broad tasks produce large diffs that are
   hard to implement cleanly and hard to review.
3. **There is no real post-implementation review loop** — `analyze` checks
   artifact consistency, but nothing systematically reviews implemented code
   back against the spec and gates. In particular, circular tests (implementation
   asserts what implementation produced, not what the spec requires) pass green
   but prove nothing.

SpecKit Prime keeps the canonical Spec-Kit order **exactly** intact and adds the
missing connective tissue:

- **Slice refinement** (`refine-slices`) after `tasks` — cut every task into the
  smallest independently shippable vertical slice.
- **A bounded QA/review→refine loop** (`qa-review`) after `implement` — review
  each slice against the spec and checklists, route defects back to the right
  owner, converge in a fixed number of iterations or escalate.
- **Resumability** (`resume-detect`) — start from whatever artifacts already
  exist (constitution, spec, plan, tasks) instead of re-running from scratch.
  Validates the freshness and traceability of existing artifacts before reuse.
- **A disciplined human gate** (`clarify-gate`) — autonomous by default; the
  CEO is the only agent that talks to the human, and only on material ambiguity
  batched into a single, decision-ready message.

## Spec Kit Artifact Contract

Spec Kit's own project structure is a core contract. Feature work lives under
`specs/<feature-id>/`, with artifacts such as `spec.md`, `plan.md`,
`research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`, `tasks.md`,
and `checklists/`. The workflow uses `.specify/feature.json`,
`SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY`, and the local `.specify/scripts/{bash,powershell}/`
helpers when available instead of guessing paths. Agents never hand-create
feature folders, invent the `NNN` number, or create branches themselves —
they invoke the Spec-Kit commands and let the scripts do it.

## Review Loop Bounds

The review loop is intentionally bounded:

- If requirements are unclear, return to `/speckit.clarify`.
- If acceptance criteria are weak, return to `/speckit.checklist`.
- If architecture or scope is too broad, refine after `/speckit.plan` and rerun `/speckit.tasks`.
- If task chunks are too large, refine tasks (re-run `refine-slices`) before `/speckit.analyze`.
- If implementation fails QA, return to the smallest affected task or slice before continuing.
- If a slice cannot converge within the loop bound, the CTO escalates to the CEO, who escalates to the human.

## Presets

The `presets/` directory accepts Spec-Kit community presets that seed the
constitution and plan phases for specific project types. Adding a preset never
changes the pipeline order, the slice-refinement pass, the QA/review→refine
loop, or the human-escalation gate.
